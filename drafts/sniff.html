<h2 id=abstract>Abstract</h2>

<p>Many web servers supply incorrect Content-Type header fields with their HTTP
responses.  In order to be compatible with these servers, user agents consider
the content of HTTP responses as well as the Content-Type header fields when
determining the effective media type of the response.  This document describes
an algorithm for determining the effective media type of HTTP responses that
balances security and compatibility considerations.

<h2 id=introduction><span class=secno>1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The HTTP Content-Type header field indicates the media type of an HTTP
response.  However, many HTTP servers supply a Content-Type that does not match
the actual contents of the response.  Historically, web browsers have tolerated
these servers by examining the content of HTTP responses in addition to the
Content-Type header field to determine the effective media type of the
response.

<p>Without a clear specification of how to "sniff" the media type, each user
agent implementor was forced to reverse engineer the behavior of the other user
agents and to develop their own algorithm.  These divergent algorithms have
lead to a lack of interoperability between user agents and to security issues
when the server intends an HTTP response to be interpreted as one media type
but some user agents interpret the responses as another media type.

<p>These security issues are most severe when an "honest" server lets
potentially malicious users upload files and then serves the contents of those
files with a low-privilege media type (such as text/plain or image/jpeg).
(Malicious servers, of course, can specify an arbitrary media type in the
Content-Type header field.)  In the absence of media type sniffing, this
user-generated content would not be interpreted as a high-privilege media type,
such as text/html.  However, if a user agent does interpret a low-privilege
media type, such as image/gif, as a high-privilege media type, such as
text/html, the user agent has created a privilege escalation vulnerability in
the server.  For example, a malicious user might be able to leverage content
sniffing to mount a cross-site script attack by including JavaScript code in
the uploaded file that a user agent treats as text/html.

<p>This document describes a content sniffing algorithm that carefully balances
the compatibility needs of user agent implementors with the security
constraints.  The algorithm has been constructed with reference to content
sniffing algorithms present in popular user agents, an extensive database of
existing web content, and metrics collected from implementations deployed to a
sizable number of users <xref target="BarthCaballeroSong2009" />.

<p>Whenever possible, user agents SHOULD NOT employ a content sniffing
algorithm.  However, if a user agent does employ a content sniffing algorithm,
the user agent SHOULD use the algorithm in this document because using a
different content sniffing algorithm than servers expect causes security
problems.  For example, if a server believes that the client will treat a
contributed file as an image (and thus treat it as benign), but a user agent
believes the content to be HTML (and thus privileged to execute any scripts
contained therein), an attacker might be able to steal the user's
authentication credentials and mount other cross-site scripting attacks.


<h2 id=conventions><span class=secno>2 </span>Conventions</h2>

<P>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip
any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to
be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc)
used in introducing the algorithm.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can
be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are
intended to be easy to understand and are not intended to be
performant.


<h2 id=metadata><span class=secno>3 </span>Metadata</h2>

<p>The explicit media type metadata information associated with sequence
of octets depends on the protocol that was used to fetch the octets.

<p>For octets received via HTTP, the Content-Type HTTP header field, if
present, indicates the media type. Let the official-type be the media type
indicted by the HTTP Content-Type header field, if present.  If the
Content-Type header field is absent or if its value cannot be interpreted as a
media type (e.g. because its value doesn't contain a U+002F SOLIDUS ('/')
character), then there is no official-type.  (Such messages are invalid
according to RFC2616.

<p>If an HTTP response contains multiple Content-Type header
fields, the user agent MUST use the textually last Content-Type header
field to the official-type. For example, if the last
Content-Type header field contains the value "foo", then there is no
official media type because "foo" cannot be interpreted as a media
type (even if the HTTP response contains another Content-Type header
field that could be interpreted as a media type).

<p>For octets fetched from the file system, user agents should use
platform-specific conventions (e.g., operating system file extension/type
mappings) to determine the official-type.

<p class=note>It is essential that file extensions are not used for determining
the media type for octets fetched over HTTP because, in some cases, file
extensions can be supplied by malicious parties. For example, most PHP
installations let the attacker append arbitrary path information to URLs (e.g.,
http://example.com/foo.php/bar.html) and thereby determine the file extension.

<p>For octets fetched over some other protocols, e.g. FTP RFC0959, there is no
type information.

<p class=note>Comparisons between media types, as defined by MIME
specifications, are done in an ASCII case-insensitive manner.  [RFC2046]


<h2 id=web-pages><span class=secno>4 </span>Web Pages</h2>

<p>The user agent MUST use the following algorithm to determine the
<var>sniffed-type</var> of a sequence of octets:

<ol>
 <li>If the user agent is configured to strictly obey the
 <var>official-type</var>, then let the <var>sniffed-type</var> be the
 <var>official-type</var> and
 abort these steps.

 <li>If the octets were fetched via HTTP and there is an HTTP Content-Type
 header field and the value of the last such header field has octets that
 <strong>exactly</strong> match the octets contained in one of the following
 lines:

 <table>
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Bytes in Hexadecimal</th><th>Textual Representation</th></tr>

<h2 id=text-or-binary><span class=secno>5 </span>Text or Binary</h2>

<p>This section defines the <dfn id=rules-for-text-or-binary>rules for
distinguishing if a resource is text or binary</dfn>.

<ol>
 <li>The user agent MAY wait for 512 or more octets to arrive.

 <p class=note>Waiting for 512 octets octets to arrive causes the
 text-or-binary algorithm to be deterministic for a given sequence of octets.
 However, in some cases, the user agent might need to wait an arbitrary length
 of time for these octets to arrive. User agents SHOULD wait for 512 octets to
 arrive, when feasible.

 <li>Let <var>n</var> be the smaller of either 512 or the number of octets that
 have already arrived.

 <li>If <var>n</var> is greater than or equal to 3, and the first 2 or 3 octets
 match one of the following octet sequences:

 <table>
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Bytes in Hexadecimal</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tbody>
   <tr><td>FE FF</td><td>UTF-16BE BOM</td></tr>
   <tr><td>FF FE</td><td>UTF-16LE BOM</td></tr>
   <tr><td>EF BB BF</td><td>UTF-8 BOM</td></tr>
 </table>

 ...then let the <var>sniffed-type</var> be "text/plain" and abort these steps.

 <li>If none of the first <var>n</var> octets are binary data octets then let
 the <var>sniffed-type</var> be "text/plain" and abort these steps.

 <table>
  <thead>
   <tr><th>Binary Data Byte Ranges</th></tr>
  <tbody>
   <tr><td>0x00&ndash;0x08a</td></tr>
   <tr><td>0x0B</td></tr>
   <tr><td>0x0E&ndash;0x1A</td></tr>
   <tr><td>0x1C&ndash;0x1F</td></tr>
 </table>

 <li>If the first octets match one of the octet sequences in the "pattern"
 column of the table in the "unknown type" section below, ignoring any rows
 whose cell in the "security" column says "scriptable" (or "n/a"), then let the
 <var>sniffed-type</var> be the type given in the corresponding cell in the
 "sniffed type" column on that row and abort these steps.

 <p class=warning>It is critical that this step not ever return a scriptable
 type (e.g., text/html), because otherwise that would allow a privilege
 escalation attack.

 <li>Otherwise, let the <var>sniffed-type</var> be "application/octet-stream"
 and abort these steps.
</ol>

<h2 id=unknown-type><span class=secno>6 </span>Unknown Type</h2>

<ol>
 <li>The user agent MAY wait for 512 or more octets to arrive for the same
 reason as in the "text or binary" section above.

 <li>Let <var>n</var> be the smaller of either 512 or the number of octets that
 have already arrived.

 <li>For each row in the table below:
  <dl class=switch>
   <dt>If the row has no "WS" octets:
   <dd>
    <ol>
     <li>Let <var>pattern-length</var> be the length of the pattern.

     <li>If <var>n</var> is smaller than <var>pattern-length</var> then skip
     this row.</t>

     <li>Apply the bit-wise "and" operator to the first
     <var>pattern-length</var> octets and the given mask, and let the result be
     the <var>masked-data</var>.

     <li>If the octets of the <var>masked-data</var> matches the given pattern
     octets exactly, then let the <var>sniffed-type</var> be the type given in
     the cell of the third column in that row and abort these steps.
    </ol>
   <dt>If the row has a "WS" octet or a "_>" octet:
   <dd>
    <ol>
     <li>Let <var>index-pattern</var> be an index into the mask and pattern
     octet strings of the row.

     <li>Let <var>index-stream</var> be an index into the octet stream being
     examined.

     <li>LOOP: If <var>index-stream</var> points beyond the end of the octet
     stream, then this row doesn't match and skip this row.

     <li>Examine the <var>index-stream</var>-th octet of the octet stream as
     follows:
      <dl class=switch>
       <dt>If the <var>index-pattern</var>-th octet of the pattern is a normal
       hexadecimal octet and not a "WS" octet or a "_>" octet:
       <dd>
        <ol>
         <li>If the bit-wise "and" operator, applied to the
         <var>index-stream</var>-th octet of the stream and the
         <var>index-pattern</var>-th octet of the mask, yield a value different
         than the <var>index-pattern</var>-th octet of the pattern, then skip
         this row.

         <li>Otherwise, increment <var>index-pattern</var> to the next octet in
         the mask and pattern and <var>index-stream</var> to the next octet in
         the octet stream.
        </ol>
       <dt>Otherwise, if the <var>index-pattern</var>-th octet of the pattern
       is a "WS" octet:
       <dd>
        <p class=note>"WS" means "whitespace", and allows insignificant whitespace to be
        skipped when sniffing for a type signature.

        <ol>
         <li>If the <var>index-stream</var>-th octet of the stream is one of
         0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII FF), 0x0D (ASCII CR),
         or 0x20 (ASCII space), then increment only the <var>index-stream</var>
         to the next octet in the octet stream.

         <li>Otherwise, increment only the <var>index-pattern</var> to the next
         octet in the mask and pattern.
        </ol>
       <dt>Otherwise, if the <var>index-pattern</var>-th octet of the pattern
       is a "_>" octet:
       <dd>
        <p class=note>"_>" means "space-or-bracket", and allows HTML tag names
        to terminate with either a space or a greater than sign.

        <ol>
         <li>If <var>index-stream</var>-th octet of the stream is different
         than 0x20 (ASCII space) or 0x3E (ASCII ">"), then skip this row.

         <li>Otherwise, increment <var>index-pattern</var> to the next octet in
         the mask and pattern and <var>index-stream</var> to the next octet in
         the octet stream.
        </ol>
      </dl>

     <li>If <var>index-pattern</var> does not point beyond the end of the mask
     and pattern octet strings, then jump back to the LOOP step in this
     algorithm.

     <li>Otherwise, let the <var>sniffed-type</var> be the type given in the
     cell of the third column in that row and abort these steps.
    </ol>
  </dl>

 <li>If the first n octets match the signature for MP4 (as define in <xref

<p>User agents MAY support additional types if necessary, by implicitly
adding to the above table. However, user agents SHOULD NOT not use any
other patterns for types already mentioned in the table above because
this could then be used for privilege escalation (where, e.g., a server
uses the above table to determine that content is not HTML and thus safe
from cross-site scripting attacks, but then a user agent detects it as
HTML anyway and allows script to execute). In extending this table, user
agents SHOULD NOT introduce any privilege escalation
vulnerabilities.

<p class=note>The column marked "security" is used by the algorithm in the
"text or binary" section, to avoid sniffing text/plain content as a type that
can be used for a privilege escalation attack.

 <li>If <var>n</var> is less than <var>box-size</var> or if <var>box-size</var>
 is not evenly divisible by 4, then the sequence does not match the signature
 for MP4 and abort these steps.

 <li>If octets 5 through 8 (inclusive) of the sequence are not 0x66 0x74 0x79
 0x70 (the ASCII string "ftyp"), then the sequence does not match the signature
 for MP4 and abort these steps.

  <li>If <var>i</var> is equal to 3, continue to the next <var>i</var>, if any.

 the first 512 octets, or which is beyond the end of the octet stream, the
 algorithm stops and the <var>sniffed-type</var> is "text/html".
